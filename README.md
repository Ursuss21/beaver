# ThesisFrontend

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 14.2.6. It is currently using [Angular](https://angular.io/docs)
version 15.0.0.

## Installation steps

To be able to run the project locally, you will need to have node.js installed with the version, that is supporting currently used Angular (check [compatibility](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/60248452/is-there-a-compatibility-list-for-angular-angular-cli-and-node-js)). The CI/CD flow is currently defined with the version 16 and that's the recommended one.

Next steps are as follows:

- run `npm install` inside of the `thesis-frontend` folder
- run `npm run start` to start the local dev server, by default it will run on `http://localhost:4200/` and it will reload after every change you make
- run `npm run test` to execute unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io)
